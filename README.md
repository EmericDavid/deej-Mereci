# deej

deej is an **open-source hardware volume mixer** for Windows and Linux PCs. It lets you use real-life sliders (like a DJ!) to **seamlessly control the volumes of different apps** (such as your music player, the game you're playing and your voice chat session) without having to stop what you're doing.

 [**Original branch**](https://github.com/omriharel/deej)

deej consists of a [lightweight desktop client](#features) written in Go, and an Arduino-based hardware setup that's simple and cheap to build. [**Check out some versions built by members of our community!**](./community.md)

## Features

deej is written in Go and [distributed](https://github.com/omriharel/deej/releases/latest) as a portable (no installer needed) executable.

- Bind apps to different sliders
  - Bind multiple apps per slider (i.e. one slider for all your games)
  - Bind the master channel
  - Bind "system sounds" (on Windows)
  - Bind specific audio devices by name (on Windows)
  - Bind currently active app (on Windows)
  - Bind all other unassigned apps
- Control your microphone's input level
- Lightweight desktop client, consuming around 10MB of memory
- Runs from your system tray
- Helpful notifications to let you know if something isn't working

> **Looking for the older Python version?** It's no longer maintained, but you can always find it in the [`legacy-python` branch](https://github.com/omriharel/deej/tree/legacy-python).

## How it works

### Hardware

- The sliders are connected to 5 (or as many as you like) analog pins on an Arduino Nano/Uno board. They're powered from the board's 5V output (see schematic)
- The board connects via a USB cable to the PC

#### Schematic

### Software

- The code running on the Arduino board is a C program constantly writing current slider values over its serial interface
- The PC runs a lightweight [Go client](./pkg/deej/cmd/main.go) in the background. This client reads the serial stream and adjusts app volumes according to the given configuration file


You can find the arduino sketch [here](./arduino/deej-5-sliders-vanilla/deej-5-sliders-vanilla.ino).

You will also need this library [Simple5641AS](./arduino/Simple5641AS.zip) that you will need to import inside the arduino IDE. It's a modified version of this repo of [adrian200223](https://github.com/adrian200223/Simple5641AS/tree/main)


## Slider mapping (configuration)

deej uses a simple YAML-formatted configuration file named [`config.yaml`](./config.yaml), placed alongside the deej executable.

The config file determines which applications (and devices) are mapped to which sliders, and which parameters to use for the connection to the Arduino board, as well as other user preferences.

**This file auto-reloads when its contents are changed, so you can change application mappings on-the-fly without restarting deej.**

It looks like this:

```yaml
# process names are case-insensitive
# you can use 'master' to indicate the master channel, or a list of process names to create a group
# you can use 'mic' to control your mic input level (uses the default recording device)
# you can use 'deej.unmapped' to control all apps that aren't bound to any slider (this ignores master, system, mic and device-targeting sessions) (experimental)
# windows only - you can use 'deej.current' to control the currently active app (whether full-screen or not) (experimental)
# windows only - you can use a device's full name, i.e. "Speakers (Realtek High Definition Audio)", to bind it. this works for both output and input devices
# windows only - you can use 'system' to control the "system sounds" volume
# important: slider indexes start at 0, regardless of which analog pins you're using!
slider_mapping:
  0: master
  1: msedge.exe
  2: discord.exe
  3: deej.unmapped
  4: 

# set this to true if you want the controls inverted (i.e. top is 0%, bottom is 100%)
invert_sliders: false

# settings for connecting to the arduino board
com_port: COM6
baud_rate: 9600

# adjust the amount of signal noise reduction depending on your hardware quality
# supported values are "low" (excellent hardware), "default" (regular hardware) or "high" (bad, noisy hardware)
noise_reduction: default
```

- `master` is a special option to control the master volume of the system _(uses the default playback device)_
- `mic` is a special option to control your microphone's input level _(uses the default recording device)_
- `deej.unmapped` is a special option to control all apps that aren't bound to any slider ("everything else")
- On Windows, `deej.current` is a special option to control whichever app is currently in focus
- On Windows, you can specify a device's full name, i.e. `Speakers (Realtek High Definition Audio)`, to bind that device's level to a slider. This doesn't conflict with the default `master` and `mic` options, and works for both input and output devices.
  - Be sure to use the full device name, as seen in the menu that comes up when left-clicking the speaker icon in the tray menu
- `system` is a special option on Windows to control the "System sounds" volume in the Windows mixer
- All names are case-**in**sensitive, meaning both `chrome.exe` and `CHROME.exe` will work
- You can create groups of process names (using a list) to either:
    - control more than one app with a single slider
    - choose whichever process in the group that's currently running (i.e. to have one slider control any game you're playing)


### Bill of Materials

- An Elegoo Uno (a clone of an arduino)
- 5 slider [potentiometers](https://www.amazon.fr/dp/B081JNQ7MM). **It need to be linear**
- a display 5641AS
- Some wires
- 3D print box

### Build procedure

- Connect everything according to the [schematic](#schematic)
- Test with a multimeter to be sure your sliders are hooked up correctly
- Flash the Arduino chip with the sketch in [`arduino\deej-5-sliders-vanilla`](./arduino/deej-5-sliders-vanilla/deej-5-sliders-vanilla.ino)
  - _Important:_ If you have more or less than 5 sliders, you must edit the sketch to match what you have
- After flashing, check the serial monitor. You should see a constant stream of values separated by a pipe (`|`) character, e.g. `0|240|1023|0|483`
  - When you move a slider, its corresponding value should move between 0 and 1023
- Congratulations, you're now ready to run the deej executable!

## How to run

### Requirements

#### Windows

- Windows. That's it

#### Linux

- Install `libgtk-3-dev`, `libappindicator3-dev` and `libwebkit2gtk-4.0-dev` for system tray support. Pre-built Linux binaries aren't currently released, so you'll need to [build from source](#building-from-source). If there's demand for pre-built binaries, please [let me know](https://discord.gg/nf88NJu)!

### Download and installation

- Head over to the [releases page](https://github.com/omriharel/deej/releases) and download the [latest version](https://github.com/omriharel/deej/releases/latest)'s executable and configuration file (`deej.exe` and `config.yaml`)
- Place them in the same directory anywhere on your machine
- (Optional, on Windows) Create a shortcut to `deej.exe` and copy it to `%APPDATA%\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup` to have deej run on boot

### Building from source

If you'd rather not download a compiled executable, or want to extend deej or modify it to your needs, feel free to clone the repository and build it yourself. All you need is a Go 1.14 (or above) environment on your machine. If you go this route, make sure to check out the [developer scripts](./pkg/deej/scripts).

Like other Go packages, you can also use the `go get` tool: `go get -u github.com/omriharel/deej`. Please note that the package code now resides in the `pkg/deej` directory, and needs to be imported from there if used inside another project.
